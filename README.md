This is my first qt program, something i wrote after reading "C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4, Second Edition". it's just the UI for a chess program. this represents a couple of days reading the book and then 4 days of typing, after not having used c++ outside of job application puzzles in several years.

the best part is that c++11 has lots of cool features, for instance the auto keyword and lambdas, and qt works just fine with all that stuff. i used a c++ lambda as part of the animation of centering chess pieces of putting them back where they came from for false moves.

there's no actual chess knowledge in the code so the part that determines a good vs bad move is just a stub.

now i've done application programming on the following platforms:

java/swing
X11/motif
MacOS
OS X
iOS
qt

it's all the same. the hardest was probably MacOS because you had to deal with memory allocation at a primitive level -- that crude OS exposed you to memory fragmentation issues.
